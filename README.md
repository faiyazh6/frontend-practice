The `Courses.tsx` file serves as the core component responsible for rendering a list of courses fetched from a JSON file. It utilizes React's state management capabilities, employing the `useState` hook to manage various state variables such as `cart`, `open`, `searchQuery`, `filterNumber`, and `expandedDescription`. Through a user interface, users can search for courses by title or description and filter them by course number. The component also features a toggleable course description and allows users to add courses to a cart with an "Add to Cart" button. Importantly, it enforces a constraint where the maximum number of courses allowed in the cart cannot exceed 7.

In contrast, `ShareCourses.tsx` offers a distinct functionality where users can generate shareable links for selected courses. Leveraging React's `useState` hook, it manages the state variable `shareableLink`. Users have the capability to generate a shareable link based on their selected courses and copy the generated link to the clipboard, providing an efficient means of sharing course selections with others.

Moving to `Checkout.tsx`, this component is primarily responsible for facilitating the checkout process by displaying the items present in the cart along with their corresponding quantities and total prices. Additionally, it showcases the shipping address and offers a button through which users can confirm their purchase. The component's visual presentation is enhanced through CSS styles, as defined in the accompanying `Checkout.css` file, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing checkout experience.

The `Cart.tsx` component focuses on presenting the courses currently added to the cart. Leveraging React Router DOM for navigation, it renders a list of courses within the cart, offering users a seamless transition to the checkout process through a dedicated button. The component's design and layout are further refined with the help of CSS styles defined in the accompanying `Cart.css` file, ensuring consistency and clarity in cart presentation.

At the core of the application lies `App.tsx`, serving as the orchestrator of routing and state management. It leverages React Router DOM to define routes for different application pages, including Courses, Cart, Checkout, and ShareCourses. Through the `useState` hook, it manages crucial state variables such as `filteredCourses`, `cartItems`, `shippingAddress`, and `show`, enabling efficient data management and application flow control. The component's structure and functionality promote a seamless user experience, allowing users to navigate through different pages and interact with course selections effortlessly.

Lastly, the `Nav.tsx` component is responsible for rendering the navigation bar, providing users with an intuitive and visually appealing means of navigating through the application. Utilizing CSS styles defined in `Nav.css`, it ensures that the navigation bar's title is presented in a consistent and aesthetically pleasing manner, contributing to the overall user interface design and experience.
